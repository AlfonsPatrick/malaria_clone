The dataset used for this project is the Malaria Blood Smear dataset from Kaggle, obtained by the National Institute of Health (NIH) from its official website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/. It consists of 27,558 images, divided into two categories: *people infected with malaria* and *people not infected with malaria*. The infected blood smear images contain a ring-shaped parasite, which is the key indicator for identifying malaria infection.
